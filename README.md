# VIT_SPARC20
Data samples are generated in VIT campus and captured using Wireshark. There are four broad categories of traffic in the data set namely unencrypted normal, unencrypted abnormal,encrypted normal and encrypted abnormal. In addition, there are total of 32 class labels which are detailed in the labels file.
Initial Number of attributes : 24. After Feature Set Reduction: 9
Attribute characteristics: Integer, decimal and nominal values.

Sl.No	Attribute	Values  - Initial Attribute Set

1	Frame size	Integer
2	Epoch time	Decimal
3	Time delta from pre-vious captured packet	Decimal
4	Time delta from pre-vious displayed packet	Decimal
5	Time since reference of first frame	Decimal
6	Frame number	Integer
7	Protocols in frame	Nominal
8	Coloring rule name	Nominal(takes value 1 or 2)
9	Coloring rule string	Nominal(takes value 1 or 2)
10	Sequence 	Integer
11	Acknowledgement	Integer
12	Length	Integer
13	File data	Integer
14	Total length	Integer
15	Identification	Integer
16	Time to live	Integer
17	Window size value	Integer
18	Calculated window size	Integer
19	Window scaling factor	Integer
20	Time since first frame in this tcp stream	Decimal
